  <p>I don't need you.</p>
  <p>Dreams, only to see you</p>
  <p>I don't need you.</p>
  <p>Blanking these months through</p>
  <p>Grandfather's whiskey, please fill me</p>
  <p>Awash in spirit, is he ghosting me?</p>
  <p>My life - I meant love - unassuring.</p>
  <p>On highways in your care - I mean car</p>
  <p>Streamed our years,</p>
  <p>Turned to fears.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>Recently I was given the opportunity to display some of my older works in a large, printed coffee-table book. The publishers were eager to see some of the drafts leading up to these pieces and even wanted to include prints of them as well. Unfortunately I had only rendered these at roughly 2,000px per side, which at the requested 400dpi would print at a measly 5 Ã— 5 inches.</p>
Despite keeping my source code in version control, I had not been creating a commit (saving a snapshot of all the code) for each image I rendered. On top of that, I wasn&rsquo;t storing the parameters I used for each render anywhere (things like the <code>seed</code> to my random number generator). This makes it virtually impossible to recreate these images over a year later.
